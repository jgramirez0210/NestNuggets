# **Project Title**  
Nest Nuggets  

# **Motivation**  
This project aims to empower tenants by providing a platform to share and access honest reviews about rental properties. This initiative seeks to address a critical gap in the rental market by recognizing the challenge of identifying potential issues with properties, such as HVAC problems, general noise levels, or various quirks with the property that can significantly impact the comfort and livability of a home. By allowing past and current tenants to leave detailed feedback on their experiences, the app aims to foster a transparent, fair, and informed renting environment. The goal is not only to help prospective renters make better-informed decisions before committing to a lease but also to encourage landlords and property managers to maintain higher standards of quality and responsiveness. Ultimately, this project aspires to transform the rental landscape where honesty and accountability lead to better outcomes for all parties involved.

# **Installation**
- Create a Firebase project and set up authentication. Use these videos as a refresher if needed.
- Create a .env file at the root of the project
- Copy/paste the contents of the .env.sample file into your newly created .env file.
- Copy over all of your Firebase values into the .env file.
- Open the package.json file and change the name property to the name of your application and author to your name.
- From your command line, be in the root directory and run npm install OR npm i for short.
- Next, run npm run prepare. This command sets up husky to track eslint errors on commits that will make your deployment fail on Netlify.
- To start your application, run npm run dev. THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU WILL USE TO RUN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER FROM NOW ON.
- Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser.
