Project Title  
Nest Nuggets  

Motivation  
This project aims to empower tenants by providing a platform to share and access honest reviews about rental properties. This initiative seeks to address a critical gap in the rental market by recognizing the challenge of identifying potential issues with properties, such as HVAC problems, general noise levels, or various quirks with the property that can significantly impact the comfort and livability of a home. By allowing past and current tenants to leave detailed feedback on their experiences, the app aims to foster a transparent, fair, and informed renting environment. The goal is not only to help prospective renters make better-informed decisions before committing to a lease but also to encourage landlords and property managers to maintain higher standards of quality and responsiveness. Ultimately, this project aspires to transform the rental landscape where honesty and accountability lead to better outcomes for all parties involved.
